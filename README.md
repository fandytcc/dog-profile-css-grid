# A single-page portfolio for dog 

A simple front-end page to display profile of a dog (subject to change to my portfolio using React)

This single page is to learn how to create a layout with [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

## Steps to be taken
These are the steps I plan to work on this app:
1. Set up a Github project board to keep track of the development progress
2. Determine number of grid columns and grid row and confirm the grid template
3. Draw all the grids 
4. Use font awesome icons & styling

## Running Locally

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fandytcc/dog-profile-css-grid.git
cd dog-profile-css-grid
```
Open profile.html file in your browser.
